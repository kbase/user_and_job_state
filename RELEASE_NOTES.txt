UserAndJobState repo

OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
A service for 1) maintaining global KBase user state, and 2) maintaining
job state. See the API docs for more details.

VERSION: 0.2.0 (8/12/16)
-------------------------

WARNING: A database update MUST be run before deploying 0.2.0. To do so:
make create-db-update-script
./db_update -d [deploy.cfg location]

To use the kbaseworkspace authorization strategy (see below) the workspace-url
parameter must be set in the deploy.cfg file prior to starting the server.

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILIES:

- All AWE related code has been removed, and the UJS can no longer fetch jobs
from AWE.

NEW FEATURES:

- On creating a job, a user can now specify an authorization strategy and
  authorization parameter for that job instead of using the default UJS ACLs
  as the authorization source.
- Added the 'kbaseworkspace' authorization strategy, which takes an integer
  workspace ID as a string as the authorization parameter. Jobs using the
  kbaseworkspace authstrat are shared as the designated workspace is shared.
- Added the create_job2, get_job_info2, and list_jobs2 methods which can
  accept or return an authorization strategy and parameter(s). create_job,
  get_job_info, and list_jobs are now deprecated.
- Jobs can now be canceled, which puts them in a canceled state. Canceled jobs
  may not be altered further other than deletion. The user that canceled the
  job is returned by get_job_info2. Users with write access to a workspace can
  cancel jobs associated with that workspace.
- Users with administrative access to a workspace can delete jobs associated
  with that workspace when those jobs are in the error, complete, or canceled
  state.
- User specified metadata can now be associated with a job via the create_job2
  method.
- These is now a minimal documentation server at the /docs endpoint.
- The authorization URLs used by the server may now be configured.
- All configuration user id / password combinations may now be alternately
  fulfilled with a token.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:

- Fixed a bug where mongo connections would not be released when redeploying
  the server in an already running glassfish instance.

VERSION: 0.1.3 (4/9/2015)
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- None

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Updated to the new auth client. Globus APIs changed in a way that broke
  sharing with multiple users at the same time.
- Added required fields to the deploy.cfg file for user credentials to use
  when querying user data. These creds must be for an administrator of
  kbase_users so that all users are visible to the UJS service when attempting
  to share jobs.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Delete Awe jobs
- Report client stdout/stderr on suspended jobs if available
- get Awe service list
- get Awe job owners / shared lists
- listing jobs currently has a hardcoded limit of 1000 for Awe jobs. This
  needs a yet to be determined fix.
- Linking Awe and UJS jobs

VERSION: 0.1.2 (10/9/2014)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- Removed auto-deletion of UJS jobs.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- N/A

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Delete Awe jobs
- Report client stdout/stderr on suspended jobs if available

VERSION: 0.1.1 (7/29/2014)
--------------------------------------
Hotfix release to update Auth jar to most recent version with 60 day token
lifetimes.

VERSION: 0.1.0 (7/24/2014)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- Can now get the status of and share Awe jobs by providing the Awe
  job ID rather than an UJS job ID; the UJS service must be set up to
  communicate with an Awe server for this functionality to be enabled.
    - the UJS service and description fields are populated from the Awe job
      document info.service and info.description fields.
- Extended results data structure allowing more flexibility in defining
  results locations.
- UJS jobs are now auto-deleted after 6 months rather than 1.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- N/A

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Delete Awe jobs
- Report client stdout/stderr on suspended jobs if available
- get Awe service list
- get Awe job owners / shared lists
- listing jobs currently has a hardcoded limit of 1000 for Awe jobs. This
  needs a yet to be determined fix.

VERSION: 0.0.5 (7/7/2014)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- Client now has a method to deactivate SSL certification validation
  (primarily for use with self-signed certs)

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- fixed a bug where incoming timestamps could intermittently be reported as
  invalid when they're correctly formatted
- service user is now configurable in the deploy-upstart target
- date strings now may contain 'Z' for the timezone
- there is now an option in deploy.cfg to specify the number of times to
  attempt to contact MongoDB on startup

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- AWE integration

VERSION: 0.0.4 (Released 5/17/2014)
--------------------------------------

  stop does not - see the upstart script for more info)
- has_state function
- get_has_state function

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Update deployment scripts to latest versions

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- None

VERSION: 0.0.3 (Released 3/11/2014)

VERSION: 0.0.2 (Released 2/24/2014)
--------------------------------------

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- N/A

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- None

KNOWN BUGS: 
In some cases, the server can start up, apparently normally, without
establishing contact with MongoDB. In this case all calls will fail, and the
server should be restarted. This *appears* to only occur once per magellean
instance, which makes it difficult to debug.

To check whether this has occurred:

# cd /kb/deployment/lib/
# python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from biokbase.userandjobstate.client import UserAndJobState
>>> ujs = UserAndJobState('http://localhost:7083', user_id='[username]',
	password='[pwd]')
>>> ujs.create_job()
u'525c7bb0e4b0ade4bb6a6593'

The above call will fail if the server has started incorrectly.

VERSION: 0.0.1 (Released 10/14/2013)
