/* 
User and Job State service (UJS)

Service for storing arbitrary key/object pairs on a per user per service basis
and storing job status so that a) long JSON RPC calls can report status and
UI elements can receive updates, and b) there's a centralized location for 
job status reporting.

There are two modes of operation for setting key values for a user: 
1) no service authentication - an authorization token for a service is not 
	required, and any service with the user token can write to any other
	service's unauthed values for that user.
2) service authentication required - the service must pass a Globus Online
	token that identifies the service in the argument list. Values can only be
	set by services with possession of a valid token. The service name 
	will be set to the username of the token.
The sets of key/value pairs for the two types of method calls are entirely
separate - for example, the workspace service could have a key called 'default'
that is writable by all other services (no auth) and the same key that was 
set with auth to which only the workspace service can write (or any other
service that has access to a workspace service account token, so keep your
service credentials safe).

Setting objects are limited to 640Kb.

All job writes require service authentication. No reads, either for key/value
pairs or jobs, require service authentication.

The service assumes other services are capable of simple math and does not
throw errors if a progress bar overflows.

Potential job process flows:

Asysnc:
UI calls service function which returns with job id
service call [spawns thread/subprocess to run job that] periodically updates
	the job status of the job id on the job status server
meanwhile, the UI periodically polls the job status server to get progress
	updates
service call finishes, completes job
UI pulls pointers to results from the job status server

Sync:
UI creates job, gets job id
UI starts thread that calls service, providing job id
service call runs, periodically updating the job status of the job id on the
	job status server
meanwhile, the UI periodically polls the job status server to get progress
	updates
service call finishes, completes job, returns results
UI thread joins

Authorization:
Currently two modes of authorization are supported:

DEFAULT:
DEFAULT authorization uses the UJS access control lists (ACLs) stored in the
UJS database. All methods work normally for this authorization strategy. To
use the default authorization strategy, simply do not specify an authorization
strategy when creating a job.

kbaseworkspace:
kbaseworkspace authorization (kbwsa) associates each job with an integer
Workspace Service (WSS) workspace ID (the authorization parameter). In order to
create a job with kbwsa, a user must have write access to the workspace in
question. That user can then read and update (but not necessarily list) the job
for the remainder of the job lifetime, regardless of the workspace permission.

Other users must have read permissions to the workspace in order to view the
job.

Share and unshare commands do not work with kbwsa.
